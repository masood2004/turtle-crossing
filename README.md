# Turtle Crossing Game

Welcome to the **Turtle Crossing Game**, a fun and engaging game built using Python's `turtle` graphics module. The goal of the game is to navigate the turtle safely across the road while avoiding moving cars.

## Features

- Player-controlled turtle that moves up and down.
- Randomly generated cars with varying colors and speeds.
- Incremental difficulty as the player progresses through levels.
- "Game Over" display when the turtle collides with a car.

## Game Rules

1. Use the **Up arrow key** to move the turtle forward.
2. Use the **Down arrow key** to move the turtle backward.
3. Avoid colliding with the cars.
4. Reach the top of the screen to advance to the next level.
5. Each level increases the speed of the cars.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/masood2004/turtle-crossing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd turtle-crossing
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.7 or later is recommended).

4. Install any required dependencies (if applicable).

## How to Play

1. Run the game script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Use the arrow keys to control the turtle and avoid cars.
3. Try to reach the finish line (top of the screen) to level up.
4. The game ends when the turtle collides with a car.
